Secure Credentials for WordPress
===============

Secure Credentials is a WordPress plugin for sharing account information with other users.

Instead of sending account information (usernames and passwords) over unsecured methods like email, use Secure Credentials and share a link to the records instead. Add users to control who can see the records you've created, and set an expiration date on records to ensure that they don't hang around too long.
